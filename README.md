# CDDA-Mods
CDDA Mods that aren't mainlined.
The other respository by RoaringJohn hasn't been updated to fix broken mods, so I'm just going to update this repository instead of making pull requests to one which seems to be abandoned.

Please report issues with these mods. Suggestions for additions are welcome, except for mods which are being actively maintained elsewhere.


Notes about these mods-
Some of these may be wildly imbalanced, it's really on a case by case basis. I don't personally use all of these mods. I'll work through issues as time and motivation allows. My goal is to have every mod load without an error on loading. 



Cata++, PK's, Arcana, and Nechronica have been removed from this repository because they are being updated elsewhere. If I can set up some sort of notification to update this repository when those updates occur, then maybe they shall be included again.

All credit for the original mods goes to their creators.

# Current update status
Check issues for the most important details. Testing performed on experimental build 10441.

Recent updates to the experimentals broke a LOT of things. Almost everything is working now, but due to the sheer number of mods and lack of time I haven't playtested everything. Hit me up with issues if you come across a bug.

ZSFixed_Extended Buildings and Roadwarrior (madmax) are borked and will not load. Hopefully fixed soonish.

Touhou mod has had golems removed becasue they were broken. I'd like to fix and add them back in eventually.

Mightiest Heroes mod throws a version error for wolverine claws CBM. Since the item is unobtainable anyway it is low priority. The error is harmless.

# Removed mods
(For reasons other than being mainlined or maintained elsewhere)
Disinfectant Powder, "powder_disinfectant", by Broken "Spaghetti" Admin- This mod doesn't add any way to create or obtain the disinfectant powder which it adds as an item, so it is effectively useless.
