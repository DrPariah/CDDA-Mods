# CDDA-Mods
CDDA Mods that aren't mainlined.
The other respository by RoaringJohn hasn't been updated to fix broken mods, so I'm just going to update this repository instead of making pull requests to one which seems to be abandoned.

Please report issues with these mods. Suggestions for additions are welcome, except for mods which are being actively maintained elsewhere.


Notes about these mods-
Some of these may be wildly imbalanced, it's really on a case by case basis. I don't personally use all of these mods. I'll work through issues as time and motivation allows. My goal is to have every mod load without an error on loading. 


No I don't know why the Shardstuff mod is labeled like that, I haven't gotten to testing its contents, consider it unverified.


Cata++, PK's, Arcana, and Nechronica have been removed from this repository because they are being updated elsewhere. If I can set up some sort of notification to update this repository when those updates occur, then maybe they shall be included again.

All credit for the original mods goes to their creators.

# Current update status
Check issues for details

Recent updates to the experimentals broke a LOT of things, including cannibal recipes, 40mm grenades, some old flags, and some old ways of entering numbers. MOST of these have been fixed, but there are still some known issues that should be fixed soon.

ZSFixed_Extended Buildings and Roadwarrior (madmax) are borked and will not load. Hopefully fixed soonish.

Touhou has a borked vehicle but is otherwise fine, and will load. Fixed soon.

eps_cbm throws an error that seems to be harmless, so it will load. If I can figure out what the problem is it'll be fixed soon.
