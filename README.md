# CDDA-Mods
CDDA Mods that aren't mainlined.
The other respository by RoaringJohn hasn't been updated to fix broken mods, so I'm just going to update this repository instead of making pull requests to one which seems to be abandoned.
Please report issues with these mods.

Notes about these mods-
Some of these may be wildly imbalanced, it's really on a case by case basis. I don't personally use all of these mods. I'll work through issues as time and motivation allows. My goal is to have every mod load without an error on loading. It is NOT at this state yet. However many mods have been updated. Report issues as they arise and maybe one day this entire heap will work.

Cata++ and PK's have been removed from this repository because they are being updated elsewhere. If I can set up some sort of notification to update this repository when those updates occur, then maybe they shall be included again.
